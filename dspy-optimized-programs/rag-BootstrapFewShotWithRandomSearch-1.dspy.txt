Prompt engineering leverages a model\u2019s inherent capabilities with minimum necessity for external knowledge and model adaption. RAG can be likened to providing a model with a tailored textbook for information retrieval, ideal for precise information retrieval tasks. In contrast, FT is comparable to a student internalizing knowledge over time, suitable for scenarios requiring replication of specific structures, styles, or formats. RAG excels in dynamic environments by offering real-time knowledge updates and effective utilization of external knowledge sources with high interpretability.

A typical approach, such as RA-DIT[27], aligns the scoring functions between Retriever and Generator using KL divergence. VAugmentation process in RAG In the domain of RAG, the standard practice often involves a singular (once) retrieval step followed by generation, which can lead to inefficiencies and sometimes is typically insufficient for complex problems demanding multi-step reasoning, as it provides a limited scope of information[105]. Many studies have optimized the retrieval process in response to this issue, and we have summarised them in Figure5. V-AIterative Retrieval Iterative retrieval is a process where the knowledge base is repeatedly searched based on the initial query and the text generated so far, providing a more comprehensive knowledge base for LLMs. This approach has been shown to enhance the robustness of subsequent answer generation by offering additional contextual references through multiple retrieval iterations.

          "Target Historically, RAG models assessments have centered on their execution in specific downstream tasks. These evaluations employ established metrics suitable to the tasks at hand. For instance, question answering evaluations might rely on EM and F1 scores[45,72,59,7], whereas fact-checking tasks often hinge on Accuracy as the primary metric[4,42,14]. BLEU and ROUGE metrics are also commonly used to evaluate answer quality[26,78,52,32]. Tools like RALLE, designed for the automatic evaluation of RAG applications, similarly base their assessments on these task-specific metrics[160]. Despite this, there is a notable paucity of research dedicated to evaluating the distinct characteristics of RAG models.The main evaluation objectives include: Retrieval Quality. Evaluating the retrieval quality is crucial for determining the effectiveness of the context sourced by the retriever component. Standard metrics from the domains of search engines, recommendation systems, and information retrieval systems are employed to measure the performance of the RAG retrieval module. Metrics such as Hit Rate, MRR, and NDCG are commonly utilized for this purpose[161,162]. Generation Quality.

Prompt engineering leverages a model\u2019s inherent capabilities with minimum necessity for external knowledge and model adaption. RAG can be likened to providing a model with a tailored textbook for information retrieval, ideal for precise information retrieval tasks. In contrast, FT is comparable to a student internalizing knowledge over time, suitable for scenarios requiring replication of specific structures, styles, or formats. RAG excels in dynamic environments by offering real-time knowledge updates and effective utilization of external knowledge sources with high interpretability. However, it comes with higher latency and ethical considerations regarding data retrieval.
